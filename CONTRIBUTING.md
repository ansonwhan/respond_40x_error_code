===================================================

Respond_40x_error_code is a community project.

If you'd like to participate in Respond_40x_error_code development, thank you!

If you are new to Drupal or open source in general, have no fear. Respond_40x_error_code is an easy-going project where you can learn some things about how to work on a collaborative project in a friendly environment.


Policies
--------

Respond_40x_error_code follows the Drupal core process as much as possible.

Contributions thus need to be similar in quality to Drupal core patches. Contributions will need to meet the following minimum standards:

### Normal Drupal issue process

Drupal projects use patches related to issues. You should know how to make a patch and an interdiff using git. It's fine to develop on github or what-have-you, but eventually it has to be a patch that can be reviewed in the normal Drupal issue process. See the list of resources for some information on how to do this.

Your patch will also need to be reviewed by someone other than yourself. Learn about the review process in the resources section.

### DrupalCI

Respond_40x_error_code uses the Drupal automated testing system to verify the applicability of patches. See `TESTING.md` for details.

### Drupal coding standards

All code in Respond_40x_error_code should adhere to the Drupal core coding standards. Respond_40x_error_code uses the Drupal Coder project and PHP_CodeSniffer to enforce coding standards. Think of this as another test your code must pass. See `STANDARDS.md` for details.
